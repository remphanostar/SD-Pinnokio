2. **Performance Monitoring**: Continuous performance monitoring and optimization
3. **Compatibility Testing**: Regular compatibility testing with desktop Pinokio
4. **Incremental Development**: Build and test incrementally

## Dependencies and Blockers

### External Dependencies

- **Cloud Platform APIs**: Integration with various cloud provider services
- **Pinokio.md**: Complete API specification for faithful implementation
- **cleaned_pinokio_apps.json**: Database of 284 applications to support

### Internal Dependencies
- **Phase Dependencies**: Each phase depends on previous phase completion
- **Function Dependencies**: Core functions must be implemented before advanced features
- **Testing Dependencies**: Testing requires working implementations

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (Pending User Decisions)
1. **Await User Clarification**: Resolve strategic conflicts
2. **Update Plans**: Modify development plans based on user decisions
3. **Begin Implementation**: Start with Phase 1 after decisions are made

### Post-Decision Actions
1. **Repository Setup**: Set up chosen repository structure
2. **Environment Configuration**: Configure development environment
3. **Core Implementation**: Begin with core engine implementation
4. **Continuous Testing**: Implement testing throughout development

This roadmap provides a clear path forward for PinokioCloud development while maintaining flexibility for user decisions and ensuring comprehensive coverage of all requirements.
