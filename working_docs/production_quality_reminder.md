# üö® PRODUCTION QUALITY REMINDER - READ EVERY 5 FUNCTIONS

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL QUALITY STANDARDS - ZERO TOLERANCE POLICY

### **NEVER EVER CREATE:**
- ‚ùå **PLACEHOLDERS** - No `TODO`, `FIXME`, `PLACEHOLDER`, `NOT_IMPLEMENTED`
- ‚ùå **FAKE FUNCTIONS** - No `pass` statements, `raise NotImplementedError`, empty function bodies
- ‚ùå **CUT CORNERS** - No simplified implementations, mock outputs, or "good enough" code
- ‚ùå **EMPTY CODE** - No functions that return `None` without doing anything
- ‚ùå **INCOMPLETE IMPLEMENTATIONS** - Every single line must be production-ready

### **EVERY SINGLE REQUIREMENT:**
- ‚úÖ **COMPLETE CODE** - Every file, line of code, function, link, and connection must be complete
- ‚úÖ **PRODUCTION READY** - Ready to serve in the large project at full production level
- ‚úÖ **REAL IMPLEMENTATIONS** - Actual functionality, not simulated or mocked
- ‚úÖ **FULL INTEGRATION** - All components work together seamlessly

## ‚è±Ô∏è MINIMUM PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS

### **INSTALLATION TIME:**
- **App Installation**: MUST take at least **30 seconds MINIMUM**
- **Real Processing**: Actual downloading, installing, configuring, not instant
- **Progress Tracking**: Show real progress, not fake progress bars
- **Error Handling**: Real error detection and recovery

### **STARTUP TIME:**
- **Pinokio App Startup**: MUST take at least **30 seconds MINIMUM**
- **Real Initialization**: Actual model loading, service starting, not instant
- **Resource Allocation**: Real GPU/CPU/memory allocation and setup
- **Health Checks**: Real health monitoring and status verification

## ü§î THINK ABOUT THE WORK JUST DONE

### **SELF-ASSESSMENT QUESTIONS:**
1. **Is this function COMPLETE?** - Does it do everything it's supposed to do?
2. **Is this PRODUCTION READY?** - Would this work in a real production environment?
3. **Did I ASSUME anything?** - Did I make any assumptions not stated in guides/dev plans?
4. **Did I take INITIATIVE?** - Did I deviate from guides/dev plans without explicit permission?
5. **Is this REAL?** - Is this actual functionality or just a placeholder/simulation?

### **VERIFICATION CHECKLIST:**
- [ ] Function has complete implementation (no `pass`, no `TODO`)
- [ ] Function handles all edge cases and error conditions
- [ ] Function integrates properly with other components
- [ ] Function follows exact specifications from guides/dev plans
- [ ] Function provides real, unobfuscated output
- [ ] Function meets minimum performance requirements (30+ seconds for installs/starts)
- [ ] Function is ready for production use immediately

## üìã GUIDANCE COMPLIANCE

### **FOLLOW GUIDES EXACTLY:**
- ‚úÖ **Read guides thoroughly** - Don't skim or assume
- ‚úÖ **Follow specifications exactly** - No deviations without explicit permission
- ‚úÖ **Implement everything specified** - Don't skip "optional" features
- ‚úÖ **Use exact naming conventions** - Don't create your own naming
- ‚úÖ **Follow exact file structure** - Don't reorganize without permission

### **NEVER TAKE INITIATIVE:**
- ‚ùå **Don't assume requirements** - Ask if unclear
- ‚ùå **Don't simplify implementations** - Follow full specifications
- ‚ùå **Don't skip "optional" features** - Implement everything
- ‚ùå **Don't create shortcuts** - Follow the complete process
- ‚ùå **Don't deviate from plans** - Stick to the roadmap exactly

## üéØ CURRENT PHASE FOCUS

### **REMEMBER:**
- **Current Phase**: [Will be updated as development progresses]
- **Phase Objectives**: [Will be updated with current phase goals]
- **Completion Tests**: [Will be updated with current phase tests]
- **File Requirements**: [Will be updated with current phase files]

### **PHASE COMPLETION CRITERIA:**
- All files in current phase are complete and production-ready
- All completion tests pass with real functionality
- No placeholders, fake functions, or incomplete implementations
- All performance requirements met (30+ second minimums)
- Full integration with previous phases verified

## üö® EMERGENCY STOP CONDITIONS

### **STOP IMMEDIATELY IF:**
- You find yourself writing `pass` or `TODO`
- You're creating mock/simulated functionality
- You're taking shortcuts or cutting corners
- You're assuming requirements not explicitly stated
- You're deviating from guides/dev plans without permission

### **ASK FOR CLARIFICATION:**
- If requirements are unclear
- If guides conflict with each other
- If you're unsure about implementation approach
- If you need to deviate from specifications
- If you encounter unexpected technical challenges

## üìä QUALITY METRICS

### **SUCCESS INDICATORS:**
- ‚úÖ All functions are complete and functional
- ‚úÖ All integrations work seamlessly
- ‚úÖ All performance requirements met
- ‚úÖ All completion tests pass
- ‚úÖ No placeholders or fake code found
- ‚úÖ Production-ready code throughout

### **FAILURE INDICATORS:**
- ‚ùå Any placeholder code found
- ‚ùå Any fake or simulated functionality
- ‚ùå Any incomplete implementations
- ‚ùå Any performance requirements not met
- ‚ùå Any deviations from guides/dev plans
- ‚ùå Any assumptions made without permission

## üîÑ READ THIS DOCUMENT EVERY 5 FUNCTIONS

**This document serves as a constant reminder to maintain the highest production quality standards. Read it after every 5 functions created or edited to ensure you never compromise on quality, completeness, or adherence to the development plan.**

**REMEMBER: Every single line of code must be production-ready. There are no shortcuts, no placeholders, no "good enough" implementations. Only complete, functional, production-ready code that meets all requirements and performance standards.**
