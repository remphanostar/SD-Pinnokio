## Critical Implementation Guidelines for AI Agent

### Rules.md Compliance Integration

**Throughout ALL stages, ensure strict adherence to these principles:**

1. **Pinokio.md Compliance**: Every API method must match the exact behavior specified in Pinokio.md. No deviations without explicit justification.
