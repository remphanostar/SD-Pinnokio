## Development Rules & Constraints

Based on `rules.md` and development plan requirements, the following constraints MUST be adhered to:

### üîí Core Development Principles

- **Variable Substitution**: Full support for {{platform}}, {{gpu}}, {{args.*}}, {{local.*}} system
- **Daemon Process Support**: Honor daemon: true flag for background processes
- **Virtual Environment Isolation**: Exactly like desktop Pinokio behavior

### üö´ Forbidden Actions
- Do NOT change notebook deployment structure
- Do NOT modify ngrok token setup workflow
- Do NOT alter GitHub clone workflow
- Do NOT break backward compatibility with existing apps
- Do NOT deviate from Pinokio.md without justification

### ‚ö° Implementation Priority Order
1. Complete missing engine methods (run_app, stop_app, uninstall_app)
2. Implement core Pinokio API (shell.run, fs.*, script.*)
3. Add complete variable substitution system
4. Implement daemon process management
5. Add advanced features (virtual drives, error recovery)
6. Optimize performance and polish UI
